Wallet implementation

## HD Wallet
[src/keychain.py](keychain.py) contains an initial implementation of the key derivation scheme specified in [BIP-0032] (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki). It is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography implementation ([ecc.py](ecc.py)) from the course material of [Programming Blockchain](http://programmingblockchain.com) seminar given by [Jimmy Song](https://twitter.com/jimmysong). The original Programming Blockchain(PB) codebase can be found in [https://github.com/jimmysong/pb-exercises](https://github.com/jimmysong/pb-exercises).
